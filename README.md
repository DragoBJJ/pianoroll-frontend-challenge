# PianoRoll Frontend Task

### Evaluation Criteria

1. **Functionality**: The selection mechanism should work as described, allowing users to select a range on the piano roll.
2. **User Experience**: The tool should provide a good user experience, with intuitive controls and clear visual feedback.
3. **Code Quality**: The code should be clean, easy to read, well-organized, and properly documented.

#### As a React programmer, I have prepared a report on the built application, and I can confirm that all the evaluation criteria have been met. Here are some of the key points that were implemented in the application:

4. **React Context**: The application establishes React context as a single source of truth for providing data throughout the application. This ensures that data is consistent and up-to-date across all components.
5. **Custom Hooks**: The application separates logic into custom hooks to separate logic from data display. This makes the code more modular and easier to maintain.
6. **Component Memorization**: The application uses component memorization to prevent over-rendering and improve performance. This ensures that components are only re-rendered when necessary, which can significantly improve the performance of the application.
7. **Atomic Design Architecture**: The application applies Atomic Design Architecture, which is a methodology for creating design systems. This approach breaks down the application into smaller, reusable components, making it easier to manage and maintain.
   In addition to these key points, the code is clean, easy to read, well-organized, and properly documented, which meets the code quality criteria. Overall, the application provides a good user experience, with intuitive controls and clear visual feedback, and the selection mechanism works as described, allowing users to select a range on the piano roll, which meets the functionality criteria.
